== Goals

Vision: A service that provides a simple, indented, collaborative
list of items (be they tasks or otherwise) with a minimum barrier to creating,
using, and sharing a list.

=== Simple

The interface needs to be simple and completely intuitive (like Gmail Tasks).
This means no "New item" button and no "Save" button.  The interface must allow
arrow key navigation as well as "click anywhere to edit".

=== Indented

Items can be indented with the TAB key and un-indented with SHIFT-TAB.  No item
can be indented more than one stop further than it's parent.  This implies a
child-parent heriarchy, but that is not forced.

=== Collaborative

The application must be able to deal with multiple users editing the same list
at the same time, changes shouldn't conflict and other should know who else is
currently editing the list

=== Barrier to Entry

There must NOT be a sign-up process, though users can if they want to,
they must be able to create a list and begin editing with one click.  They must
be able to share the list by just passing a URL.
